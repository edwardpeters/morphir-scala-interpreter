## Test Usage

This morphir project exists to provide a framework for running tests.

The elm code in this project may be used to run specific tests using native elm functionality, with minimal reporting on what led tests to fail. Alternatively, the unit test functionality in morphir-scala will automatically run every top-level definition of type "Test"
